# This file is run by main_test.rb.  It starts a separate server
# process that main_spec.rb queries to make sure things get set up and
# work correctly with require "angelo/main" which we don't want to
# require in the test process because it wants to take over: parse
# args, add methods to main, and run a server.  So we isolate it in
# its own process here.
